  ICGC and Amazon have partnered to offer low-cost and scalable computing solutions for analysing ICGC data 
  on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank"><i class="icon-external-link"></i>AWS EC2</a>. 
  Raw read data, genome alignments, and associated metadata produced by the <a href="/pcawg">ICGC PanCancer Analysis of Whole 
  Genomes (PCAWG) study</a> in addition to data submitted by ICGC projects to the 
  <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/" target="_blank"><i class="icon-external-link"></i>European Genome Archive (EGA)</a> 
  is periodically gathered, curated and incrementally uploaded to Amazon S3 for the benefit of the cancer 
  research community. An up-to-date summary of the repository's data content is provided on the right. Our 
  <a href="http://docs.icgc.org/cloud/guide/"><i class="icon-external-link"></i>user guide</a> provides step-by-step instructions on how to access and analyse ICGC data on AWS. This data and
  associated search and access tools is managed by the ICGC Data Coordination Center (DCC). Read-level data 
  is in the controlled tier, and you will need to obtain approval from the <a href="https://icgc.org/daco" target="_blank"><i class="icon-external-link"></i>ICGC Data Access Compliance Office 
  (DACO)</a> in order to obtain the decryption keys necessary to access this data.

<p style="text-indent: initial;">
  <strong>The data produced by the PCAWG project, including somatic mutations, is subject to a publication embargo.</strong> 
  Please see the <a href="/pcawg#embargo">PCAWG publication and embargo policy</a> for the embargo terms.

<h3>PCAWG Workflows</h3>
<div class="confine-column">
The PCAWG project has created standardized, whole genome workflows for alignment using BWA-Mem and variant calling using best practice processes from the 
<a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/" target="_blank"><i class="icon-external-link"></i>Sanger Institute</a>, the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/" target="_blank"><i class="icon-external-link"></i>Broad Institute</a>, 
and <a href="https://www.dkfz.de/" target="_blank"><i class="icon-external-link"></i>DKFZ</a> / <a href="http://www.embl.de/" target="_blank"><i class="icon-external-link"></i>EMBL</a>. These are made available to the research community via a &quot;launcher&quot; AMI that allows users to analyze 
their data using the same workflows. Currently supporting the BWA alignment workflow, this system makes it easy for users to load their data into AWS S3, 
launch many VMs simultaneously to analyze data in parallel, and write the resulting alignments back to S3.  Over time, the full range of PanCancer workflows 
will be made available.
